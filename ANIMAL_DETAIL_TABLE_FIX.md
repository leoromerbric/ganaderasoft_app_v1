# Animal Detail Table Fix - Issue #53

## Problem Summary
Fresh installations of the app were experiencing database errors during animal synchronization:
```
E/SQLiteLog: (1) no such table: animal_detail in "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO animal_detail..."
```

This occurred because the `animal_detail` table was only created during database upgrades (version < 6) but not during fresh database creation.

## Root Cause
- Fresh installations use `_createDatabase()` method which did not include `animal_detail` table creation
- Existing users upgrading from older versions got the table via `_upgradeDatabase()` method
- This created a discrepancy between fresh installs and upgraded installations

## Solution Implemented
Added `animal_detail` table creation to the `_createDatabase` method in `lib/services/database_service.dart`:

```dart
// Create animal_detail table
await db.execute('''
  CREATE TABLE animal_detail (
    id_animal INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    animal_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    etapa_animales_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    etapa_actual_data TEXT,
    estados_data TEXT,
    local_updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
  )
''');
```

## Why This Fix Works
1. **Minimal Change**: Only adds table creation to fresh installation path
2. **Exact Match**: Table structure matches exactly with upgrade path
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing upgrade logic remains unchanged
4. **Complete Coverage**: Now all installation types have the required table

## Files Modified
1. `lib/services/database_service.dart` - Added table creation in `_createDatabase`
2. `test/animal_detail_table_fix_test.dart` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `test/manual_verification_animal_detail_fix.dart` - Manual verification script
4. `test/animal_detail_error_scenario_test.dart` - Exact error scenario test
5. `test/manual_verification_db_fix.dart` - Updated to include animal_detail check

## Testing Strategy
- ✅ Fresh installation scenario (main fix)
- ✅ Database upgrade scenario (regression prevention)
- ✅ Table structure verification
- ✅ Actual insert/query operations
- ✅ Integration with DatabaseService methods

## Impact
- ✅ No more "no such table: animal_detail" errors on fresh installations
- ✅ Animal synchronization works immediately after login
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ No performance impact

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Fresh installation will have `animal_detail` table from start
2. `saveAnimalDetailOffline()` will work without errors
3. Animal synchronization will complete successfully
4. No regression in existing functionality

This fix resolves the issue described in #53 where clean installations failed during animal data synchronization.
