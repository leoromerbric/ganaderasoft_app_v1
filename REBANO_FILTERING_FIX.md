# Fix for Rebano (Herd) Filtering Issue #17

## Problem Description
When selecting a specific rebano (herd) from the rebanos list, the animals screen was showing all animals from the farm instead of filtering to show only animals from the selected rebano.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `_loadAnimales()` method in `AnimalesListScreen`. The code was setting:
```dart
_filteredAnimales = _animales;
```
This assigned all loaded animals to the filtered list without applying the rebano filter, even when a specific rebano was selected.

## Solution
Added client-side filtering logic after loading data to ensure proper rebano filtering:

```dart
// Apply rebano filter if one is selected
if (_selectedRebano != null) {
  _filteredAnimales = _animales.where((animal) => 
    animal.idRebano == _selectedRebano!.idRebano
  ).toList();
} else {
  _filteredAnimales = _animales;
}
```

## How the Fix Works

### Navigation from Rebanos List (Primary Fix)
1. User selects a specific rebano from the rebanos list
2. App navigates to `AnimalesListScreen` with `selectedRebano` set
3. `_loadAnimales()` attempts to fetch animals for that rebano
4. **NEW:** Client-side filter ensures only animals from the selected rebano are displayed
5. Result: User sees only animals from the selected rebano

### Navigation from Farm Details (Unchanged)
1. User views all animals from a farm (no rebano pre-selected)
2. App navigates to `AnimalesListScreen` with `selectedRebano = null`
3. All animals are loaded and displayed
4. Dropdown filter remains available for manual filtering

### Refresh and Manual Filtering (Enhanced)
- Pull-to-refresh maintains the current rebano filter
- Manual dropdown filtering continues to work as expected
- Both use the same filtering logic for consistency

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/animales_list_screen.dart` - Main fix in `_loadAnimales()` method
- `test/animales_filtering_test.dart` - Unit tests for filtering logic
- `test/manual_verification.dart` - Manual test scenarios documentation

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Navigate to a Finca** with multiple rebanos and animals
2. **Go to Rebanos list** for that finca
3. **Select a specific rebano** (e.g., "Rebaño 1")
4. **Verify**: Only animals from that rebano are displayed
5. **Pull to refresh**: Filter should be maintained
6. **Navigate back and try another rebano**: Should show different animals

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Animals screen shows only animals from selected rebano
- ✅ Empty state message adapts to rebano context
- ✅ Refresh maintains the rebano filter
- ✅ Navigation from farm details still shows all animals
- ✅ Manual dropdown filtering (when visible) works correctly

## Backward Compatibility
This fix maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing navigation flows continue to work
- Server/database filtering logic remains unchanged
- UI behavior is preserved for all scenarios
- No breaking changes to API contracts

## Why This Fix is Robust
1. **Defensive Programming**: Works regardless of server/database filtering success
2. **Consistent Logic**: Same filtering logic used for manual and automatic filtering
3. **Clear Intent**: Code clearly shows when and why filtering is applied
4. **Minimal Changes**: Only modifies the specific problematic area
5. **Comprehensive**: Handles all navigation scenarios correctly
