# Manual verification script for Auto-Sync on Screen Start functionality
echo "=== Manual Verification of Auto-Sync on Screen Start ==="
echo ""
echo "This script outlines how to manually verify the auto-sync functionality:"
echo ""

echo "1. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER CHANGES:"
echo "   - When user opens 'Registros Pendientes' screen:"
echo "     * Pending records are automatically loaded (no need to click 'Cargar Registros')"
echo "     * If internet connection is available AND pending records exist:"
echo "       → Auto-sync starts automatically after 500ms delay"
echo "       → User sees sync progress indicators"
echo "       → Records are synchronized automatically"
echo "     * If no internet connection:"
echo "       → Auto-sync is skipped silently"
echo "       → User can still manually sync later when connected"
echo "     * If no pending records:"
echo "       → Auto-sync is skipped (nothing to sync)"
echo ""

echo "2. TESTING SCENARIOS:"
echo "   A. With pending records and internet:"
echo "      - Create animals/personal offline"
echo "      - Ensure internet connection"
echo "      - Open 'Registros Pendientes' screen"
echo "      - Expected: Auto-sync starts immediately, progress shown"
echo ""
echo "   B. With pending records but no internet:"
echo "      - Create animals/personal offline"
echo "      - Disable internet connection"
echo "      - Open 'Registros Pendientes' screen"
echo "      - Expected: Records loaded, no sync attempt, manual sync button available"
echo ""
echo "   C. No pending records:"
echo "      - Ensure all records are synced"
echo "      - Open 'Registros Pendientes' screen"
echo "      - Expected: 'No hay registros pendientes' message, no sync needed"
echo ""

echo "3. LOGS TO WATCH FOR:"
echo "   - 'Starting automatic sync check on screen initialization'"
echo "   - 'Found X pending records with connectivity, starting auto-sync'"
echo "   - 'No connectivity available, skipping auto-sync'"
echo "   - 'No pending records found, skipping auto-sync'"
echo ""

echo "4. UI ELEMENTS TO VERIFY:"
echo "   - Records load immediately (no 'Cargar Registros' button needed)"
echo "   - Sync progress bar appears when auto-sync starts"
echo "   - Success/error messages show after sync completion"
echo "   - Manual sync button still works for manual operations"
echo ""

echo "5. TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE:"
echo "   - _autoLoadOnInit changed from false to true"
echo "   - _startAutoSync() method implemented with:"
echo "     * Connectivity checking"
echo "     * Pending records verification"
echo "     * Graceful error handling"
echo "     * Appropriate logging"
echo "   - Auto-sync call enabled in initState()"
echo ""

echo "The implementation ensures that auto-sync only runs when appropriate"
echo "and doesn't interfere with manual user actions or cause errors."
