# This script provides manual testing commands to verify the offline functionality

echo "=== Manual Verification Guide for Farm Management Offline Functionality ==="
echo ""
echo "This implementation adds offline functionality for:"
echo "1. Cambios de animales (Animal Changes)"
echo "2. Peso Corporal (Body Weight)"
echo "3. Lactancia (Lactation)"
echo ""
echo "=== Key Features Implemented ==="
echo ""
echo "DATABASE LAYER:"
echo "- Database version updated to 11"
echo "- Added is_pending and pending_operation columns to cambios_animal, lactancia, peso_corporal tables"
echo "- Implemented offline save/retrieve/sync methods for all three entities"
echo ""
echo "UI LAYER:"
echo "- CreateCambiosAnimalScreen now supports offline creation"
echo "- CreateLactanciaScreen now supports offline creation"
echo "- CreatePesoCorporalScreen now supports offline creation"
echo "- All screens show appropriate feedback for offline vs online saves"
echo ""
echo "SYNC LAYER:"
echo "- PendingSyncScreen now syncs all three new farm management record types"
echo "- Added visual indicators for each record type (icons and colors)"
echo "- Enhanced sync progress reporting"
echo ""
echo "=== Manual Testing Steps ==="
echo ""
echo "1. TEST OFFLINE CREATION:"
echo "   a) Disable device internet connection"
echo "   b) Navigate to farm management sections"
echo "   c) Create Cambios Animal records - should save offline with orange notification"
echo "   d) Create Lactancia records - should save offline with orange notification"
echo "   e) Create Peso Corporal records - should save offline with orange notification"
echo ""
echo "2. TEST PENDING RECORDS DISPLAY:"
echo "   a) Navigate to 'Registros Pendientes' screen"
echo "   b) Verify all three record types appear with correct icons:"
echo "      - Cambios Animal: blue update icon"
echo "      - Lactancia: purple water drop icon"
echo "      - Peso Corporal: indigo fitness center icon"
echo "   c) Verify record count shows pending items"
echo ""
echo "3. TEST SYNCHRONIZATION:"
echo "   a) Re-enable internet connection"
echo "   b) In 'Registros Pendientes' screen, click 'Sincronizar mis cambios'"
echo "   c) Verify sync progress shows for all record types"
echo "   d) Verify records disappear from pending list after successful sync"
echo "   e) Verify records appear in online lists with server-assigned IDs"
echo ""
echo "4. TEST OFFLINE BANNER:"
echo "   a) Verify offline banner shows creation capability for farm management"
echo "   b) Test that offline creation works from different entry points"
echo ""
echo "=== Database Changes ==="
echo "- cambios_animal table: Added is_pending, pending_operation columns"
echo "- lactancia table: Added is_pending, pending_operation columns"
echo "- peso_corporal table: Added is_pending, pending_operation columns"
echo ""
echo "=== New Methods Added ==="
echo "DatabaseService:"
echo "- savePendingCambiosAnimalOffline()"
echo "- getPendingCambiosAnimalOffline()"
echo "- markCambiosAnimalAsSynced()"
echo "- savePendingLactanciaOffline()"
echo "- getPendingLactanciaOffline()"
echo "- markLactanciaAsSynced()"
echo "- savePendingPesoCorporalOffline()"
echo "- getPendingPesoCorporalOffline()"
echo "- markPesoCorporalAsSynced()"
echo ""
echo "PendingSyncScreen:"
echo "- _syncPendingCambiosAnimal()"
echo "- _syncPendingLactancia()"
echo "- _syncPendingPesoCorporal()"
echo ""
echo "=== Testing Results Expected ==="
echo "✓ Records save offline with temporary negative IDs"
echo "✓ Offline records appear in pending sync screen"
echo "✓ Records sync successfully and get real server IDs"
echo "✓ UI provides appropriate feedback for offline vs online operations"
echo "✓ No data loss during sync process"
echo "✓ Existing online functionality remains unchanged"
echo ""
echo "=== Test File Created ==="
echo "- test/farm_management_offline_test.dart"
echo "  Contains comprehensive tests for all new offline functionality"
echo ""
echo "=== Implementation Complete ==="
echo "The offline functionality for Cambios de animales, Peso Corporal, and Lactancia"
echo "has been successfully implemented following the same robust pattern used for"
echo "Animals and Personal de Finca."
