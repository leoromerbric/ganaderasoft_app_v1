# Manual verification script for offline record modification fix
echo "=== Manual Verification of Offline Record Modification Fix ==="
echo ""
echo "This script outlines the expected behavior after the fix for Issue #95:"
echo ""

echo "ISSUE SCENARIO - Before Fix (BROKEN):"
echo "1. User creates animal offline → pending_operation = 'CREATE'"
echo "2. User modifies same animal offline → pending_operation = 'UPDATE' (WRONG!)"
echo "3. User syncs → tries to UPDATE non-existent record → FAILS"
echo ""

echo "FIXED SCENARIO - After Fix (WORKING):"
echo "1. User creates animal offline → pending_operation = 'CREATE'"
echo "2. User modifies same animal offline → pending_operation = 'CREATE' (PRESERVED!)"
echo "3. User syncs → CREATES record with final data → SUCCESS"
echo ""

echo "TEST SCENARIOS COVERED:"
echo "✅ Animal created offline + modified offline = stays CREATE"
echo "✅ PersonalFinca created offline + modified offline = stays CREATE"
echo "✅ Already synced record modified offline = uses UPDATE (no regression)"
echo "✅ Record with existing UPDATE operation = stays UPDATE"
echo ""

echo "CODE CHANGES MADE:"
echo "• Modified savePendingAnimalUpdateOffline() to check existing pending_operation"
echo "• Modified savePendingPersonalFincaUpdateOffline() to check existing pending_operation"
echo "• If current operation is 'CREATE', it's preserved"
echo "• If current operation is 'UPDATE' or null, it becomes 'UPDATE'"
echo ""

echo "FILES MODIFIED:"
echo "• lib/services/database_service.dart (core fix)"
echo "• test/offline_record_modification_test.dart (test coverage)"
echo ""

echo "TO VERIFY MANUALLY:"
echo "1. Create an animal while offline"
echo "2. Edit the same animal while still offline"  
echo "3. Check database: pending_operation should be 'CREATE'"
echo "4. Connect to internet and sync"
echo "5. Verify animal is created successfully on server"
echo ""

echo "EXPECTED LOG OUTPUT:"
echo "• [DEBUG] Preserving CREATE operation for offline-created animal: <name> (ID: <id>)"
echo "• [INFO] Pending animal update saved offline: <name> (ID: <id>) with operation: CREATE"
echo ""

echo "Fix resolves Issue #95: 'Modificacion de registros creados offline'"
