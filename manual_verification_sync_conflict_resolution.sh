echo "=== Implementation Summary ==="
echo
echo "Core Features Implemented:"
echo "  ★ UTC timestamp handling for consistent timezone management"
echo "  ★ Conflict resolution logic comparing local vs server timestamps"
echo "  ★ Sync audit table for tracking conflicts and resolutions"
echo "  ★ UI screen for viewing sync history with filtering"
echo "  ★ Preservation of local changes when they are newer than server"
echo "  ★ Comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios"
echo
echo "Files Modified/Created:"
echo "  • lib/models/sync_audit_models.dart (NEW)"
echo "  • lib/services/utc_timestamp_helper.dart (NEW)"
echo "  • lib/screens/sync_audit_screen.dart (NEW)"
echo "  • test/sync_conflict_resolution_test.dart (NEW)"
echo "  • lib/services/database_service.dart (MODIFIED)"
echo "  • lib/services/sync_service.dart (MODIFIED)"
echo "  • lib/screens/home_screen.dart (MODIFIED)"
echo
echo "The implementation addresses the original issue by:"
echo "  1. Comparing timestamps before overwriting local changes"
echo "  2. Preserving local data when it's newer than server data"
echo "  3. Creating audit logs for transparency and debugging"
echo "  4. Using UTC timestamps to avoid timezone issues"
echo "  5. Providing UI access to view sync conflicts and resolutions"
