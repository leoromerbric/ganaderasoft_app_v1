# Manual verification script for the synchronization fix
echo "=== Manual Verification of Synchronization Fix ==="
echo ""
echo "This script outlines the expected behavior after the fix:"
echo ""

echo "1. BEFORE FIX - The problematic flow:"
echo "   - Animal created offline with tempId (e.g., -1758291494054)"
echo "   - User clicks sync when connected"
echo "   - AuthService.createAnimal() succeeds, returns Animal with realId (e.g., 30)"
echo "   - PROBLEM: AuthService calls saveAnimalesOffline([animal]) which replaces the pending record"
echo "   - markAnimalAsSynced(tempId, realId) fails because tempId record no longer exists"
echo "   - Result: Error 'Animal with tempId not found or already synced'"
echo ""

echo "2. AFTER FIX - The corrected flow:"
echo "   - Animal created offline with tempId (e.g., -1758291494054)"
echo "   - User clicks sync when connected"
echo "   - AuthService.createAnimal() succeeds, returns Animal with realId (e.g., 30)"
echo "   - FIX: AuthService no longer calls saveAnimalesOffline([animal])"
echo "   - markAnimalAsSynced(tempId, realId) succeeds:"
echo "     * Finds record with tempId where is_pending=1 and synced=0"
echo "     * Updates: id_animal=realId, synced=1, is_pending=0"
echo "   - Result: Success! Animal no longer appears in pending list"
echo ""

echo "3. VERIFICATION STEPS:"
echo "   - Run existing tests in test/issue_69_reproduction_test.dart"
echo "   - Run new test in test/sync_fix_verification_test.dart"
echo "   - Test manually by creating animals offline and syncing"
echo ""

echo "4. EXPECTED LOG OUTPUT AFTER FIX:"
echo "   [DEBUG] Creating animal: <name>"
echo "   [INFO] Animal created successfully: <name>"
echo "   [DEBUG] Marking animal as synced: <tempId> -> <realId>"
echo "   [INFO] Animal marked as synced: <tempId> -> <realId>"
echo "   [DEBUG] Retrieving all pending records"
echo "   [INFO] 0 pending records retrieved"  # Should be 0, not 1
echo ""

echo "The fix removes the redundant saveAnimalesOffline call that was causing"
echo "the pending animal record to be replaced before it could be properly updated."
