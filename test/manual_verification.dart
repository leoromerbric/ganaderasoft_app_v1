// Manual verification script for rebano filtering issue
// This simulates the user flow described in the issue

/*
User Flow Test:
1. User is on RebanosListScreen showing rebanos for a finca
2. User taps on a specific rebano (e.g., "RebaÃ±o 1" with ID 6)
3. App navigates to AnimalesListScreen with selectedRebano = rebano
4. AnimalesListScreen should show only animals from rebano 6

Expected Behavior:
- Only animals with idRebano == 6 should be displayed
- Animals from other rebanos should be hidden

Issue (Before Fix):
- All animals from the finca were being displayed
- The rebano filter was not being applied

Fix Applied:
- Added client-side filtering after loading data in _loadAnimales()
- Ensures that _filteredAnimales only contains animals from the selected rebano

Test Scenarios:
1. Navigation from rebanos list with selectedRebano = specific rebano
   -> Should show only animals from that rebano
   
2. Navigation with selectedRebano = null (from finca details)
   -> Should show all animals from the finca
   
3. Manual filter change using dropdown (when visible)
   -> Should update the filtered list accordingly
   
4. Pull-to-refresh when rebano is selected
   -> Should maintain the rebano filter after refresh
